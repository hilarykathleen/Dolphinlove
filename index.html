            Dolphins are sea mammals that arguably have the closest spiritual, intellectual and social link to humans of all sea creatures. Many people have said if they could come back as an animal they would choose to be a dolphin. Like otters, dolphins are regarded as intelligent and fun loving animals. In some cases this is a true, but they can also be aggressive and unpredictable and their habits and behavior are far from understood.
